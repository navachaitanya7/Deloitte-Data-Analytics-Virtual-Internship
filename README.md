# Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship

This repository contains all the work completed for the Deloitte Data Analytics Virtual Internship. The project focuses on analyzing machine telemetry data to derive key business insights and showcase data analysis skills.

## 📝 Project Overview

The project's main objective was to analyze telemetry data from four Daikibo factories to answer critical business questions:

1.  In which location did machines break the most?
2.  What are the machines that broke most often in that location?

I utilized data unification and analysis techniques to provide a clear and actionable dashboard for the client.

## 📁 Repository Structure

-   **`data/`**: This folder contains all the datasets used in the project, including the raw telemetry data (`daikibo-telemetry-data.json`) and other sample data files.
-   **`documentation/`**: Here you will find project guides, requirements, and my completion certificates.
-   **`visualizations/`**: This directory holds the Tableau dashboard file (`Deloitte Task 2 Tableau Book.twbx`) and a screenshot of the final dashboard (`Dashboard 1.png`).

## 📊 Key Achievements

* Analyzed a large JSON dataset of machine telemetry readings.
* Calculated total machine downtime for different factories and machine types.
* Created an interactive dashboard in Tableau to visualize and compare factory performance.
* Identified the worst-performing factory and the machines that failed most often within that location.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Tableau**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
* **Microsoft Excel**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
